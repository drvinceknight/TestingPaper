    "\n",
    "Continuous integration is a development process where code is frequently integrated on a central continuous integration server. This centralisation allows the automation of a variety of quality assurance processes such as the building of the codebase, running of tests, checking of performance and the execution of static analysis tools. By monitoring the revision control system the server can automatically run these operations as the code is changed, giving rapid feedback to the developer. Generally these systems give a web interface to view the output of the build jobs and are also extensible to allow general automation, for example the production of tarballs or other packages for formal software release. For example this paper and its associated website are built using a [continuous integration server](https://travis-ci.org/drvinceknight/TestingPaper) as changes are made to the underlying content.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of open source and commercial continuous integration servers are available, both hosted and for self hosting. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is one of the most popular hosted options and has tight integration with the GitHub code repository. [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) is the most popular of the open source, self-hosted options and has a large community writing plugins to further extend the functionality.\n"
